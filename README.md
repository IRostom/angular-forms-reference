# AngularFormsReference

This project is a personal reference on angular forms usage. it will contain code samples divided into modules and pages depending on the use case i am documenting.
the motivation here is to build a single source for all use cases you and i can encounter while using angular forms, working with forms can sometimes get complex and i find myself wasting a couple of hours trying to make the form just work as expected and as customized to my needs.
i am hopeful this could evolve into an angular form generator with the ability to cover all use cases and customizable as much as possible.

this project will be using Angular CLI V16.2.1 and node V18.10.0

the reason i am using this version and not older versions is that i want to be up to date with any changes happening to the API at the time i started working on that project.

Also i want to highlight that i will try as possible to not use third party libraries that extends angular forms
, if i find a package that is active and provide actual benefit to me and my workflow i will add it to the project. otherwise i will try to keep it mostly native for maximum compatability.

## Packages and tools

- node V18.10.0
- Angular CLI V16.2.1
- tailwind (it's faster to work with tailwind with layouts in some cases and it was recommended in this [angular layout post](https://blog.angular.io/modern-css-in-angular-layouts-4a259dca9127))
- Angular Material V16.2.8
- 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
